## üìù Introduction

In this lab, you will learn how to exploit API endpoints by leveraging exposed documentation. By following this guide, you‚Äôll gain a deeper understanding of API testing and how to identify security flaws.

**Difficulty Level:** ‚òÖ‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜ

Let‚Äôs get started!

## üéØ Lab Objectives

Your mission is to:

1. Identify the API documentation.
2. Analyze available endpoints and methods.
3. Exploit the API to delete the `carlos` user account.

**Credentials for the lab:**

- **Username:** `wiener`
- **Password:** `peter`

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Step 1: Understanding the Scenario

### üåê Logging into the Application

1. Go to the homepage and log in with the credentials provided:

   ```plaintext
   Username: wiener
   Password: peter
   ```

2. Once logged in, click on **My Account** to explore user functionalities.

### üõ† Intercepting HTTP Traffic

Use **Burp Suite** to capture requests. For example, when updating your email address, observe the following HTTP request:

```http
PATCH /api/user/wiener HTTP/2
Host: your-lab-url
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "email": "newemail@example.com"
}
```
![Local Image](img/lab1/2_updating_the_email.png "Local Image")

From this, we identify the endpoint `/api/user/<username>` used for interacting with user data.

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Step 2: Exploring the API

### Identifying Documentation

To discover more about the API, send a `GET` request to `/api`:

```http
GET /api HTTP/2
Host: your-lab-url
```

#### API Endpoints

The response reveals the following endpoints and methods:

| Method | Endpoint              | Parameters        | Response            |
|--------|-----------------------|-------------------|---------------------|
| GET    | /user/[username]      | None              | 200 OK, User info   |
| PATCH  | /user/[username]      | {"email": String} | 200 OK, Updated info|
| DELETE | /user/[username]      | None              | 200 OK, User deleted|

The `DELETE` method stands out as it might allow deleting user accounts.

### Investigating the API Base Path

Further exploration involves examining potential documentation paths:

- `/api`
- `/swagger/index.html`
- `/openapi.json`

These can reveal additional details about the API‚Äôs functionality. In our case, the base path `/api/user/<username>` allows interaction with user accounts.

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Step 3: Exploitation in Action

### üî• Sending the DELETE Request

Our target is to delete the `carlos` account. Craft the following request:

```http
DELETE /api/user/carlos HTTP/2
Host: your-lab-url
```
![Local Image](img/lab1/6_Send_the_Exploit.png "Local Image")
### ‚úÖ Verifying Success

If the server responds with `200 OK`, the `carlos` account has been successfully deleted.

## üìå Conclusion & Learnings

In this lab, we achieved the following:

1. Discovered API documentation and endpoints.
2. Analyzed and tested HTTP methods (GET, PATCH, DELETE).
3. Exploited an unprotected DELETE endpoint to remove a user account.

### üí° Key Takeaways

- Always investigate exposed documentation for APIs.
- Test endpoints thoroughly to understand their functionality.
- Check for missing access controls, especially for sensitive operations like DELETE.
